The code contains model based on Stacked RNN, Stacked LSTM, Feed Forward Neural Nets and Transformers.

Kindly load all the three txt files in data folder before running the model. 

The current results are based on running the models on very few numbers of epochs due to time-out and memory based errors on server and google-colab.

It is requested to generate other class labels by running the code again with more number of epochs preferably between 30 to 50. The current predictions were obtained by using the model based on transformers, this might change if higher accuracy is observed by running the models over a higher number of epochs.
